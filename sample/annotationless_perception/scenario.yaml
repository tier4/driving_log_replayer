  Conditions:
    ClassConditions:
      # Describe the conditions for each class. If a class with no conditions is output, only the metrics are calculated. It does not affect the evaluation.
      # In the sample data, the class of TRUCK is also output, but the condition is not described, so TRUCK is always Success.
      # When specifying conditions from result.jsonl, only keys described here will be updated.
      # Even though TRUCK metrics appear in result.jsonl, they are not added to the evaluation condition because the TRUCK key is not specified in this example.
      CAR: # classification key
        Threshold:
          # Keys not described will not be evaluated (will always be a success)
