      BoundingBoxConfig: # Bounding box setting. If not set, state "null". Writing this key overrides the target_uuids in the SensingEvaluationConfig.

            Start: null # Evaluate the point cloud after the time specified here. If not specified, it should be written as null. null is equivalent to specifying 0.0.
            End: null # Evaluate the point cloud up to the time specified here. If not specified, it is written as null. null is equivalent to specifying sys.float_info.max.
    NonDetection: # set `null` if NonDetection is not evaluated.
