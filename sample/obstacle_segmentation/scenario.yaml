            Start: null # Evaluate the point cloud after the time specified here. If not specified, it should be written as null. null is equivalent to specifying 0.0.
            End: null # Evaluate the point cloud up to the time specified here. If not specified, it is written as null. null is equivalent to specifying sys.float_info.max.
