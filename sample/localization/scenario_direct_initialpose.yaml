  UseCaseFormatVersion: 2.0.0
  Conditions:
    Convergence:
      AllowableDistance: 0.2 # Lateral distance to be considered convergence
      AllowableExeTimeMs: 100.0 # If the NDT computation time is less than or equal to this value, it is considered successful.
      AllowableIterationNum: 30 # If the number of NDT calculations is less than or equal to this value, it is considered a success.
      PassRate: 95.0 # How much (%) of the evaluation attempts are considered successful.
    Reliability:
      Method: NVTL # NVTL or TP which method to use for evaluation
      AllowableLikelihood: 2.3 # If above this value, the localization reliability value is considered normal.
      NGCount: 10 # If the reliability value is lower than the threshold value for more than this number in the sequence. the evaluation is considered to have failed.
